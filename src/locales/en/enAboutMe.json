For the past 1.5 years, I've created solutions that are not only technically advanced but also user- and business-focused. My goal is simple: to write clean, efficient, and scalable code.",
  "text2": "My primary specialization is React. My core stack is TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Next, Redux, the Redux toolkit, and RTK Query. I'm constantly improving my skills in these technologies and actively learning new things to expand my capabilities and achieve a higher level of professionalism.",
